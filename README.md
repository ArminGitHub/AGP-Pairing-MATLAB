# AGP-RDM

A repository containing my codes to compute the norm and reduced density matrices (RDMs) of the antisymmetrized geminal wavefunction (AGP).

The details of our algorithm is described in our paper: 

J. Chem. Phys. 151, 184103 (2019): https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5127850

This repository is still under construction. I developed these codes a while ago and now collecting them all in a single repository.
